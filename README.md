# *STAR GLITCHER ~ DELIMA [V3]*
can't believe that I have to say this, but don't use this base with anything stolen. Modes, animations, ui, auras, effects etc.
If you do, then I may ask you to remove the assets or stop using the base entirely.
Also you **cannot** monetize your game which uses this base. Small functions are ok, but anything large no. (Premium Payouts don't count)

Code, Assets, UI, etc. (Only the ones made by me)
The .Rblx is in "Precompiled".
Datastores services need to be enabled for the game to function.
